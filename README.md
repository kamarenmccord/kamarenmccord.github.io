<p>Initally built as a capstone project for #VetsWhoCode</p>
<br />
<p>This project is built with</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Vanilla JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>No external libraries are needed and the package is not ran with npm</p>
<p>This was an excellent refresher for basic html, css, and js</p>
